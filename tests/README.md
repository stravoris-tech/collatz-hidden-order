# Sanity Tests

This directory may contain lightweight tests that act as executable sanity checks
for the reference implementation.

These tests are intended to verify:

- residue class behavior,
- step definitions,
- encoding/decoding consistency.

They are not exhaustive proofs and do not replace the paper’s arguments.
